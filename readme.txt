Remember the story of Disney's Aladdin? When he gets the lamp, the cave starts to collapse. Aladdin then escapes it. The game represents this very moment of the story. Escape the cave!

Go through 5 level to win. Collect all coing on a level to proceed. Use arrow keys to run and jump. You get killed if a falling rock hits you. Destroy a rock by hitting it before it falls. Press ESC to quit and P to pause. Fast! Your time is your score. 

The game is created as a final project for Introduction to CS at NYU Abu Dhabi by Oleg Grishin.
